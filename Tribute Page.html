               <p class="p1">Stephen William Hawking was an English physicist born on January 8, 1942. 
                He is considered the greatest theoretical physicist of all time. 
                He revolutionized physics with his work on the origin of the universe and the theory of black hole explosions. 
                From the Big Bang to Black Holes, all of his best-selling books have captivated physics enthusiasts around the world.
                British theoretical physicist whose theory of black hole explosions is based on the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He also worked in the space-time singularity field

            <h2 class="h21">Early Life and Education</h2>

          <p class="p2"> 
            Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942 in Oxford, England. His father was Frank Hawking, an English biologist. His mother was Isabel Walker, a Scottish graduate of Philosophy, Political Science and Economics. Both his parents were graduates of Oxford University. Stephen had his two younger sisters and his one adopted son.

           Stephen Hawking was an average student at school who was very interested in science. After winning a science scholarship at age 17, he graduated from University College, Oxford with a first class degree in physics at age 20.

           Hawking then completed his doctorate in astronomy and cosmology from Trinity Hall, Cambridge University.

           Dr. Hawking was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at the age of 21, shortly after entering Cambridge University. ALS is a motor neuron disease in which nerves that control muscles become inactive while sensory nerves function normally. Initially, his doctors expected him to die within two years of his life.

           It took him about 40 hours to give his 45 minute lecture because of this condition.

            <p class="p3">
                Hawking made important contributions to the field of general relativity. 
                They are the result of a deep understanding of what is involved in physics and astronomy, and in particular mastery of entirely new mathematical techniques. 
                After Penrose's pioneering work, partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, he advanced a series of increasingly powerful theorems that all realistic models of the universe must have a singularity. 
                established the basic result that it must Using a similar technique, Hawking proved a fundamental theorem about the laws governing Black's halls. 
                And as black holes evolve and interact, the total area of ​​the event horizon must increase. 
                Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and seminal paper on large-scale spacetime.
